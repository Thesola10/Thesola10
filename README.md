## About me
Hi, my name is Karim 👋

I do a lot of things here. My profile here is a combination of my personal interests and professional work, from **systems programming** and **language design** to **full-stack** and **DevOps**.

The through-line in all of this? I identify a need, design an experience, and finally put it to code. For users, for developers, for myself. I wield systems in service of a vision -- _why not yours?_

> _My languages_: [Amber](https://amber-lang.com), [Nix](https://nixos.org), [C](https://c-language.org), [Python](https://python.org), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Java](https://java.com), [Haskell](https://haskell.org), [OCaML](https://ocaml.org), [Unity](https://unity.com) and many more!

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see your language in the list, don't worry! I'm quick to pick up new technologies.
