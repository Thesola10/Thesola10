## About me

Always learning, coffee in hand, I'm fascinated by the _fabric_ of our modern world. I don't just want to develop applications, I am learning OS development, systems design and language design.

### Languages I use
- C
- Python
- Java (mainly Android)

### Languages I love _(still learning)_
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- [Haskell](https://haskell.org)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)

See a pattern here? Yep, I'm super interested in _functional programming_ right now!

### Languages I loathe _(but still know how to use)_
- Javascript
- Anything to do with .NET

### Extras
